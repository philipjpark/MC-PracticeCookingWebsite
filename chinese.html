        <p>Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture. Chinese food has influenced many other cuisines in
            Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates.<br><br>
            The preference for seasoning and cooking techniques often depends on historical background and regional
            differences. Geography also plays a part with mountains, rivers, forests and deserts having a strong effect
            on the local ingredients.<br><br>
            Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are
            integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.<br><br>
            China has four main cuisines. These are Chuan (west), Lu (north), Yue (south) and Huaiyang (east).<br><br>
            As with other countries, colour, smell and taste are important aspects of Chinese food. In addition to these
            the meaning, appearance and nutrition of the food is also important.<br><br>
            Chopsticks are the main eating utensils for Chinese food because it is considered inappropriate to use
            knives on the dining table.

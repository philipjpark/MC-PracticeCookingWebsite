        <p>Indian food consists of a wide variety of regional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the
            range of climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each
            other. Each uses locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.<br><br>
            Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hindu and traditions. Middle Eastern and
            Central Asian influences have also occurred on North Indian cuisine from the years of Mughal rule. Indian
            cuisine is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions with other societies.<br><br>
            Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in
            introducing certain foods to this country. For example, potato was brought to India by the
            Portuguese.<br><br>
            Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe
            was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around
            Europe and Asia.<br><br>
            Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe, the Middle
            East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, the British Isles, Fiji, and the Caribbean.

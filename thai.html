            <p>Thai food is the national cuisine of Thailand.<br><br>
                Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components and a spicy
                edge. Thai food demonstrates intricacy, attention to detail, texture, colour and taste. The use of
                ingredients with medicinal benefits, as well as good flavour is also a characteristic of Thai
                cooking.<br><br>
                In 2017, seven Thai dishes appeared on a list of the "World's 50 Best Foods". They were: tom yam goong
                (4th), pad Thai (5th), som tam (6th), massaman curry (10th), green curry (19th), Thai fried rice (24th)
                and Som Tum Pu Pla Ra (36th).<br><br>
                Thai cuisine is more accurately described as five regional cuisines, corresponding to the five main
                regions of Thailand: Bangkok, Central Thai, Isan or northeastern Thai, Northern Thai and Southern Thai.
